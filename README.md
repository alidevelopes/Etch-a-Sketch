This project was built from scratch by me.
Tools used in building this are basic HTML, CSS , and beginner level JavaScript.

Building this project helped me get more familiar with basic DOM manipulation, such as

- targeting various DOM nodes
- adding classes/IDs
- adding event listeners
- event handling

This is far from perfect, ofc, and I'll most likely come back to it later to add new feature(s), like:

- add color layers (color opacity)
